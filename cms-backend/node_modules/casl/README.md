CASL is an isomorphic authorization JavaScript library which restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. All permissions are defined in a single location (the `Ability` class) and not duplicated across controllers, views, and database queries.

Heavily inspired by [cancan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan).

npm install casl --save
```
